## <p align="center"> B. Data Analysis Questions


### 1. How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?

### Steps:
  
* Use the DISTINCT function to find the number of Foodie Fi's unique customers

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS customer_count
FROM subscriptions;
```
### Output:
|total_customers|
| -- |
|1000|

* Foodie-Fi has 1000 unique customers.
  
 
### 2. What is the monthly distribution of trial plan start_date values for our dataset - use the start of the month as the group by value

### Steps:
* Extract the months from start_date column
* COUNT the total number of plan_ids for each month
* And filter for where plan_name is Trial

```sql
SELECT month(start_date) AS months,
	   COUNT(s.plan_id) AS total_plans
FROM subscriptions AS s
INNER JOIN plans AS p
ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
WHERE plan_name = 'trial'
GROUP BY month(start_date)
ORDER BY COUNT(s.plan_id) DESC
```

#### Output:
| months | total_plans
| -- | --
| 3 | 94
| 7 | 89
| 8 | 88
| 1 | 88
| 5 | 88 
| 9 | 87
| 12 | 84
| 4 | 81
| 10 | 79
| 6 | 79
| 11 | 75
| 2 | 68
	
* March has the highest number of trial plans, whereas February has the lowest number of trial plans.
  
  
### 3. What plan start_date values occur after the year 2020 for our dataset? Show the breakdown by count of events for each plan_name

### Steps:
Question is asking for the number of plans for start dates occurring in 2021 and after grouped by plan names.

* Filter plans with start_dates occurring after 2020-12-31
* Group and order results by plan.

```sql
SELECT p.plan_name, 
	   p.plan_id,
	   COUNT(*) AS event_2021
FROM plans AS p
INNER JOIN  subscriptions AS s
ON p.plan_id = s.plan_id
WHERE s.start_date >= '2021-01-01'
GROUP BY p.plan_id, p.plan_name
ORDER BY p.plan_id;
```

### Output:
plan_name | plan_id | event_2021
-- | -- | --
basic monthly | 1 | 8
pro monthly | 2 | 60
pro annual | 3 | 63
churn | 4 | 71
	
	
* The result above showed that there was no trial plan recorded in 2021 and I was curious and ran the below query for 2020 and 2021 so I could understand the year-on-year results.


```sql
WITH events_2020 AS 
(
SELECT plan_id,
	   COUNT(*) AS event_2020
FROM subscriptions
WHERE start_date <= '2020-12-31'
GROUP BY plan_id
),

events_2021 AS (
SELECT plan_id,
	   COUNT(*) AS event_2021
FROM subscriptions
WHERE start_date >= '2021-01-01'
GROUP BY plan_id
)

SELECT COALESCE(e20.plan_id, e21.plan_id) AS plan_id, COALESCE(event_2020, 0) AS event_2020, COALESCE(event_2021, 0) AS event_2021
FROM events_2020 e20
FULL OUTER JOIN events_2021 e21
ON e20.plan_id = e21.plan_id
ORDER BY plan_id;
```
 
### Output:
plan_id| event_2020 | event_2021
-- | -- | --
0 | 1000 | 0
1 | 538 | 8
2 | 479 | 60
3 | 195 | 63
4 | 236 | 71

The result shows there was no free trial in 2020. Maybe the old customers from 2020 continued with their subscriptions in 2021,
customers upgraded from one paid trial to another, or customers signed up for paid plans without going through the trial plan.
